Music Mashup Generator

This project is a Python-based tool designed to create captivating music mashups or mixes by utilizing YouTube content. The application offers a seamless process to transform music videos of a specified musician into a single, dynamic audio mashup. The following features highlight the functionality of the project:

YouTube Scraping and Selection: Users can input the name of their desired musician, and the application automatically scrapes YouTube to retrieve a selected number of music videos associated with the artist.

Audio Extraction and Modification: The tool then extracts audio from the chosen music videos and converts them into audio files. Additionally, users have the flexibility to specify a particular duration (n seconds) for each audio snippet.

Mashup Creation: The project takes the modified audio snippets and seamlessly combines them into a single audio file. This process generates an exciting and unique music mashup that merges the essence of different tracks from the chosen musician.
